OK! Ready Freddy ...

Hm ... Barbie

What am I suppose to paint?

That's up to you.

Me?

But what if I do not have any good ideas?

You have wonderful ideas.
Your ideas.

Can not you just tell me
what to paint?

And take away the best part?

Kelly, you can created anything
you image.

I guest so.



But what if I hate it?

You know

You remind me of a story.

It's about a girl who's paintings
saved her life.

But you probably do not want to here it.

Once, long long ago,

In a time of castles, king,
and magic.

There was a secret manner
hidden deep in a dark forest.

The woods were whispered
to be full of monsters and dragons.

Even if you were brave enough
to go in to the forest, ...

you couldn't see the manner.

Why not?

It was concealed behind a magic wall.

Which keep intruders out.



And more importantly,
keep a young girl hidden inside.

Do you hear that Rapunzel?

My stomach rumbling.

I feel weak.

I see them, stars in front of me eyes!

OK, OK Hobie

We wouldn't want anyone
fainting around here.

I'm Almost done.

Look at this.

I mean, look at this painting.

I can smell the saltwater.

I Can Feel the mist.

One day, I'm going to walk along the beach

just like this one.
And see nothing but open sky

For miles and miles.

Ah oh! Gothel alert!

GOTHEL ALERT!

Go Rapunzel, go.
I'll put your art stuff away.

Thanks, Penelope.

How was your ride today my lady?

Invigorating.

I'll expect my tea in 9 minutes.

Yes, my lady.

Do not you repeat errors of yesterday.

You steam that tea for 6 minutes

I expect six and a half minutes,
no more no less.

Eh ... Of coarse.

And bring me a snack.

Oh!, your little friend will do.

What's That?

Ah!

Painting again!

What about your duties

I ... I finished them.

Oh really?

Did you make the beds?

Sweep the floors?

Weed the garden?

Yes.

Beat the rugs?

Wax the tables?

Polish the silver?

Yes me lady.

Wash and mend my clothes?

Folded and put away.

Listen to that ...

Your suppose to keep the house
in perfect order.

I do not know about ...
It's you job to know.

I've taken care of you sense you were a baby

and this is how you thank me?

By frittering away you time,

Painting.

Such trivia's.

I hope Gothel chokes on her tea.

Now, Hobie.

Wait, wait, I can do it faster.

Just Be very, very careful, Penelope.

Oh.

Nice job.

Oh, no!

I got this!

Do not think it's a quieter.

Where's the tea cup?

Oh, no, that's down right
Spooky!

What!

You do not think I got Moved.

Cause I got moves.

But.

Turn around purple girl.

Well scratch my scales...

I wonder where it goes?

Hello, what about Gothel's tea?

We still have a few minutes.

Come on. Something great could be down here.

Ah, yea, shure. Looks very inviting.

Eh .. you don't think there are spiders down there?

cause I'm not to fond of spiders...

or ... or beetles. or snakes,
I don't like them ether.

Your worried about bugs and snakes?

What about what Gothel will do to us?

If she finds out we went down there.

Da, for sure, oh yea, let's go anyway.

No one ever listens to the rabbit.

Nobody's been down here in years.

I can't imagine Gothel
attending all these balls.

Can I ask you,

who in their right mine would invite her to a party?

Would you look at this?

Oh, she sure got mad at somebody.

I wouldn't want to be in his boots.

Or his head.

What a lovely old box.

Not down here, Penelope.

I'm OK.

It's beautiful.

There's something engraved on the back.

Constant as the stars above.

Always know that you are loved.

To our daughter, Rapunzel
on her first birthday ...

With love forever,
mother and father.

This doesn't make sense.

Gothel said I was abandoned ...

when I was just a few days old.

Why would she lie to be about that?

Why do the old hag do anything
other then to torment people?

With love forever.

More junk holders.

You really pack a wallop.

Rapunzel.

Oh boy, oh boy, hurry get cleaning.

Rapunzel!

Where are you?

We'll have to come back.

Coming, my lady!

Enter.

What took you so long?

I'm sorry, I was distracted.

Lazy you mean.

Adequate.

Oh.. time! time! time!

My mistress is ready for
her beauty nap.

Step to it girl.

Will there be anything else?

No.

Go.

Don't disturb
me until dinner.

Yes my lady.

Allow me mistress.

This doesn't make sense.
Why would Gothel...
